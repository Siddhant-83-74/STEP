/*
STEPS
Create a console application / java project
Create company class and copy and paste the code given
Create Item class and copy and paste code given
Create Customer Class - No code just create
Create Registered Customer class extending Customer - No code just the class creation

 1. Naming conventions - Should be meaningful names, easily understandable

 2. Casing - Camel Casing - First letter is always small, every word starts with Capital

 if its a combination of more than one word - simpleInterest;

 Class Names - Always Capitals to be begin with 

 Method Names - CamelCasing - Verbs - calculateSimpleInterest()

 Class Variables - camel casing

 Code organisation- Structure and flow of your code

 Code Identation and Formatting - Look neat and clear. There should be

Order

Company Has-A realtionship with Item ->Done
Customer Is-A relationship with Registered Customer ->Done
Customer Has a relationship with Order ~ bidirectional ~ multiplicity ->Done



Classes, Objects Getters and setters
Interfaces
Collections - List and Map
Design Principles and Patterns - SOLID, Structural Design Patterns
Configuration Based Programming
Unit Testable Code
Test Main Code - This is very important for you to know how totest your code

~ when implementing bidirectional relationship, let say there could be multiple B 
object of class A then make a list of B class objects in class A and as it is bidirectional 
we have to make an object of class A in class B too.


We need to know total order value of the company
CEO has asked to find total orde value of the company
